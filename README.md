# 🧠 Feature Engineering & Predictive Data Preparation

This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into powerful, model-ready features using techniques learned from the *Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp (Udemy)*. It focuses on turning exploratory analysis into actionable insights through effective feature engineering and preprocessing.

## 🔍 Key Highlights

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions, detected outliers, and explored feature correlations.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created new time-based, categorical, and numerical features to improve model accuracy.
* **Preprocessing:** Applied encoding, scaling, normalization, and missing-value handling for consistent inputs.
* **Data Storytelling:** Interpreted patterns and relationships to strengthen data-driven decision-making.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Feature engineering bridges the gap between raw data and machine learning success — ensuring models learn from the most meaningful signals.
